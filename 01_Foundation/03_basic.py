# Variables :: In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
## variable names are case sensetive
 
firstName = "zaid"
lastName = "alif"

print(firstName+" "+lastName+" siddique")

## Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

# Casting :: If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

num1= int(5) # 5
str1 = str(5) # '5'
float1 = float(5) # 5.0

# We can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
